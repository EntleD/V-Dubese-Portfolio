      I got on my first aeroplane in 2012 at the age of 17, and it was to the
      USA; thus having the opportunity to visit a few states through a
      leadership scholarship in high school. Getting to have that experience,
      allowed me to dream and know that it's possible to see the world. And that
      has all that I've ever wanted.
      <br />
      <br />
      Solo traveling became the medium, because I didn't want to wait until I
      was married or a millionaire in order to access the gift and opportunity
      of travel. I wanted to travel for myself, and gift myself that gift, I
      did.
      <br />
      <br />
      Through my work as a consultant, I got the opportunity to learn about the
      impact of the arts industry, and I have been fascinated since. It's an
      expression that documents and shares the emotions of the time period, the
      subject and the intimacy of the artist through various mediums. I recently
      started collecting art, and it's the best decision ever! I only drink
      still or sparkling wines when it comes to alcohol beverages - simply
      because of the emotive tasting experience and the delicious, aromatic
      flavours.
