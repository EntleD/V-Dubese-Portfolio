        I got on my first aeroplane in 2012 at the age of 17, and it was to the USA; thus having the opportunity to visit a few states through a leadership scholarship in high school.
        Formerly an Impact Acceleration Associate at Impact Amplifier, and the
        first hire at Thomson Reuter’s first innovation lab in an emerging
        market, as the Startup Partnerships Lead for Africa, I have accumulated
        over 7 years of skills and expertise in my field.
        The clients I served were in South Africa, Tanzania, Ghana, Switzerland,
        USA and Rwanda.
        <br />
        <br />
          My fields of expertise:
          <ul>
            <div>• Innovation Strategy</div>
            <div>• Impact and M&E Design</div>

              your input and expertise, and enthusiastic approach to this! Plus
              your time! It’s been a pleasure working with and getting to know
              you.”

              “Vuyolwethu moderated our first online All4Youth work readiness
              program - Skills4Work, 23 July 2020. She moderated a session on
              Personal Branding to provide young people with tools for the world
              of work and be empowered for their next opportunity. I would
              definitely recommend Vuyolwethu to moderate or speak at any
              corporate event. She was extremely professional, well-prepared,
              articulate and engaged authentically with the audience.”

              “I have worked with Vuyo on two campaigns with two different
              objectives. One was for Absa during the WEF Africa in 2019. The
              aim of the partnership was to gain awareness for the content that
              the financial institution had created for WEF and reach a new
              audience. For Sage, was to create engagement within the SME
              community on social media. For both projects, Vuyo was exceptional
              in how she created relevant content and gave us value added
              content. She was open to all feedback given to her and was always
              giving her expertise to how we could better execute content. She
              is a pleasure to work with and one is guaranteed a return on
              investment when in a partnership with her.”
