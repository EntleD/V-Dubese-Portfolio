                (Shar-do-nay) Chardonnay is the most popular white grape since
                the 1990’s. It can be made sparkling or still. Food pairings: a
                good choice for fish (even salmon) and chicken dishes.
                Districts: chardonnay makes the principle white wine of Burgundy
                (Bourgogne, France), where it originated. Chardonnay is
                versatile and is grown with success in most viticultural areas
                under a variety of climatic conditions. Yet it only amounts to 2
                percent of the world vine areas. Total chardonnay vines cover
                more than 160,000 hectares (400,000 acres).upporting text below

                Food pairings: a versatile food wine for seafood, poultry, and
                salads. Districts: of French origin, sauvignon blanc is grown in
                the Bordeaux region where it is blended with semillon. The Loire
                valley and New Zealand produce some excellent sauvignon blanc
                varietals. Some Australian Sauvignon Blancs, grown in warmer
                areas, tend to be flat and lack fruit qualities. Typical taste
                in varietal wine: sauvignon blanc normally shows a herbal
                character suggesting yellow bell pepper or freshly mown grass.
                The dominating flavors range from sour green fruits of apples,
                pears and gooseberries through to tropical fruits of melon or
                mango. Some unoaked Sauvignon Blancs will display smokey
                qualities; they require bright aromas and a strong acid finish
                and are best grown in cool climates. For example in Sancerre and
                nearby: Quincy, Reuilly.

              <p class="card-text">
                Food pairings: versatile. Districts: pinot grigio is planted
                extensively in the Venezia and Alto Adige regions of Italy.
                Pinot grigio is also grown in the western coastal regions of the
                U.S.A. It is called malvoisie in the Loire Valley and pinot gris
                in the rest of France. In Germany and Austria pinot grigio is
                known as the Ruländer or Grauer Burgunder. Similar aliases are
                used in the german settled regions of Australia. Typical taste:
                crisp, dry wines with good acid "bite" are typically made in
                Italy and Germany. Oregon or Alsace Pinot Gris shows aromatic,
                fruity flavors. Pairing with food is more difficult because
                Alsatian winemakers leave the grapes on the vine much longer.
                The perfume in Alsatian Pinot Gris makes it especially well
                suited for Thai or spicy Chinese cuisine.

              <p class="card-text">
                Food pairings: dry versions go well with fish, chicken and pork
                dishes. The crispiness of a Riesling works very well with tuna
                and salmon while the acidity level intermingles with the slight
                smokiness of the eel and cuts through the layers of spicier
                Japanese foods. Districts: the classic German grape of the Rhine
                and Mosel, riesling grows in all wine regions. Germany's great
                Rieslings are usually made slightly sweet, with steely acidity
                for balance. Riesling from Alsace and the Eastern U.S. is also
                excellent, though usually made in a different style, equally
                aromatic but typically drier (not sweet). California Rieslings
                are much less successful, usually sweet without sufficient
                acidity for balance. Typical taste in varietal wine: Rieslings
                are much lighter than Chardonnay wines. The aromas often include
                fresh apples. The riesling variety expresses itself very
                differently depending on the district and the winemaking.
                Riesling wines should taste fresh. If they do, then they might
                also prove tastier and tastier as they age.
